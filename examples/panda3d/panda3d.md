# Panda3D example #

An example of CEF off-screen rendering using the [Panda3D](http://www.panda3d.org/) game engine. See [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tV7ei1Z40fQ) for an example of how cool it might look in a game.

## Source ##

An example for CEF 3 is an externally maintained package. See the [basic.py](https://gist.github.com/croxis/9789973) gist. For more details see [this topic](http://www.panda3d.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=16861) on the Panda3D forum.

The official example ships only with the CEF 1 binaries and wasn't yet ported to CEF 3. See [panda3d\_.py](../blob/master/cefpython/cef1/windows/binaries/panda3d_.py).
