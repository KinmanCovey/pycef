* Update to Chromium 47
* Update to Cython 0.23.4
* Unicode strings in Python 2

---
* wx.chromectrl is missing documentation in api/ docs
* package:
    private/ - cython .pyd/so modules
    __init__.py - from private.core import init,run,etc
    browser.py - from private.browser import Browser
* tox to test app (making distribs, unit tests) in multiple python
  interpreters (2.7, 3.4, 3.5)
* User shouldn't access any internal pycef modules/functions by mistake.
  - Test if defining __all__ will prevent autocompletion of other
    internal submodules in IDE. However it's better to avoid __all__
    and not allow for from pycef import *. This could cause trouble/name
    conflicts.
  - Try naming internal modules (core, browser, frame) with an underscore,
    see if this will prevent importing/showing in IDE/dir().
  - or maybe private/ package with all pycef modules. __init__.py should
    import from these explicitilly.
  - check dir(pycef) if it shows any private internal API
* Events cef abstract classes cannot be instantiated - check this in
  __init__. Use collections.abc .
* get rid of SetGlobalClientCallback (special case for:
    - OnAfterCreated
    - OnCertificateError
    - OnBeforePluginLoad). Allow to pass ClientHandler to pycef.init()
  - may pass only those two callbacks to pycef.init() and the rest
    to Browser(handlers=) -> allow to pass handlers before browser is
    created. Currently you can call SetClientHandler() only after
    browser was created.
* don't use static methods, this is not Pythonic. Create a function
  in a module.
* private python functions in modules should start with _, so that
  dir(pycef) and auto-completion in IDEs don't show them
* debpkg - use latest stdeb 0.8.5, it changes installation path but that's OK,
           breaking BC is fine.
* Releases: only Wheel package for Win/Mac and only .deb package for Linux
* installers examples:
    py2exe for Win
    py2app for Mac
    cxfreeze for Linux
* api: cefpython.module.md , thread.module.md - add ".module" otherwise
       name conflict with Thread.md class.
* docs: modules
    pycef.html
    pycef.app.html
    pycef.browser.html
* pycef.__version__
